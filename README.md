# Arista 7800R3 Line Card Organizer Design
This project contains drawings of the Arista 7800R3 series line card patch cord organizer which is custom-made for DTEL-IX and tested on high-density environment. You can download and modify the drawings accoring to your own needs.

Please, remember that:

1. This organizer is designed to be installed in standard 19-inch cabinets with a depth of 1100 mm or more (tested on Vertiv VR3100 / VR3107). We recommend cabinets with a width of 800 mm and depth of 1200 mm for such installations. It will NOT fit cabinets with a depth less then 1100 mm!
1. It is better to install this organizer on the line card before being installed in the switch. It does not interfere with the line card installation and later operations.
1. Fix the organizer after latching it on the line card tightly with cable ties using mounting holes on organizer brackets (we recommend Panduit PLT2I-C0 or similar).
1. Patch cords must be attached to the organizer with Velcro ties up to 20 mm wide (we recommend Panduit Tak-TyÂ® Hook & Loop Cable Ties).
