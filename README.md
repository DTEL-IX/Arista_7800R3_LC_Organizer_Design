# Arista 7800R3 Line Card Organizer Design
This project contains drawings of the Arista 7800R3 series line card patch cord organizer which is custom-made for DTEL-IX and tested on high-density environment. You can download and modify the drawings accoring to your own needs.

Please, remember:

1. Choose right cabinets for your installation:
  - This organizer is designed to be installed in standard 19-inch cabinets with a depth of 1100 mm or more (tested on Vertiv VR3100 / VR3107);
  - We recommend cabinets with a width of 800 mm and depth of 1200 mm for such installations;
  - The organizer **will NOT fit cabinets with a depth less then 1100 mm**!
2. It is better to install this organizer on the line card before being installed in the switch:
  - It does not interfere with the line card installation and later operations;
  - Fix the organizer after latching it on the line card tightly with cable ties using mounting holes on organizer brackets (we recommend Panduit PLT2I-C0 or similar).
3. Patch cords must be attached to the organizer with Velcro ties up to 20 mm wide (we recommend Panduit Tak-TyÂ® Hook & Loop Cable Ties).
4. We recommend using duplex 8-shaped (not uniboot) push-pull patchcords since in this case you can make a precabling and then use single fiber of a patchcord for WDM links.
